# My Favorite Memory at MESA South Brooklyn High School
My *favorite* memory at **MESA** was when we went to **Poconos/Pocono(s) Valley** for a class trip. The activites we did was *swimming in the pool*, then we went *ziplining*, and then we went *canoeing*. It was fun because I went canoeing for the first time, and I got to ride a actual zipline across the water. It was scary because I thought the rope would break and I would fall into the water. The food was great too, we had mac and cheese, burgers (patty lettuce tomato), hot dogs/glizzy, and even cookies! After lunch, they gave us ice cream. The flavors were vanilla, cookies and cream, and we got toppings like sprinkles, oreos, and even gummy bears,
